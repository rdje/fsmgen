## 2026-05-10: Check failure diagnostic contract full surface survives JSON
- Roadmap lane: `R13` public embedding/API stabilization.
- Completed slice:
  [t/1011-check-failure-diagnostic-contract-full-surface-json-roundtrip-audit.t](t/1011-check-failure-diagnostic-contract-full-surface-json-roundtrip-audit.t)
  now proves the shared failure `diagnostic` contract owner survives JSON
  encode/decode unchanged.
- Public behavior changed: no; this is a full-surface stability audit only.
- Focused validation passed:
  `prove -I perl t/331-check-failure-diagnostic-contract.t t/457-check-failure-diagnostic-contract-defensive-copy-boundary-audit.t t/1007-normalized-semantic-report-contract-full-surface-json-roundtrip-audit.t t/1009-check-diagnostics-contract-full-surface-json-roundtrip-audit.t t/1011-check-failure-diagnostic-contract-full-surface-json-roundtrip-audit.t`.
- Next bounded slice: continue public report full-surface stability audits.
