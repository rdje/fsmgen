# Symbols, Types, and Imports

This chapter covers the declarative surfaces that let you name things instead
of repeating raw numerics everywhere.

The current canonical intent-level families are:

- `+constants`
- `+enums`
- `+types`
- `+import`

Compatibility families such as `+define` and `+params` still exist in the live
tree, but they are not the long-term center of gravity for the language.

## Constants

Use `+constants` for named scalar values and bounded aggregate values.

Simple scalar example:

```lisp
(+constants
  (RESET_BYTE 8'hA5)
  (IDLE_MASK 8'h03)
)
```

Those names can then be used in direct expressions:

```lisp
(idle
  (OUT = RESET_BYTE)
  (<MODE=IDLE_MASK
    (HIT = 1)
  )
)
```

## Enums

Use `+enums` when you want named members instead of magic numbers.

```lisp
(+enums
  (mode
    (IDLE 0)
    (BUSY 1)
    (DONE 2))
)
```

Then refer to members as `mode.IDLE`, `mode.BUSY`, and so on.

This is especially useful in:

- guard equality conditions
- constant-backed aggregate values
- structural actuals in composition

## Types

The current shipped `+types` slice is intentionally semantic, not backend
spelling.

Current bounded scalar forms include:

- `bit`
- `(bits N)`
- `(signed bit)`
- `(signed (bits N))`
- `(two_state TYPE)`
- `(four_state TYPE)`
- named aliases to other scalar types

Examples:

```lisp
(+types
  (type flag bit)
  (type byte (bits 8))
  (type signed_word (signed (bits 16)))
  (type packed_flag (two_state bit))
  (type safe_bus (four_state (bits 32)))
)
```

The intent is:

- width is semantic
- signedness is semantic
- 2-state vs 4-state is semantic
- the HDL backend chooses the final spelling later

## Packed Aggregate Aliases

The first shipped aggregate type aliases are:

- `(list TYPE TYPE ...)`
- `(record (field TYPE) ...)`

Example:

```lisp
(+types
  (type nibble (bits 4))
  (type header_t (list bit nibble))
  (type frame_t
    (record
      (mode (bits 2))
      (flag bit)))
)
```

The semantic type identity is preserved through the pipeline so compatibility
checks can use more than width alone. On the SystemVerilog path, direct
generated modules and composition tops also preserve that identity into the
emitted declaration surface by synthesizing backend-owned packed typedefs for
declared aggregate aliases instead of flattening them back to raw vectors.

That means SystemVerilog may emit shapes like:

```systemverilog
typedef struct packed {
  logic [3:0] tag;
  logic flag;
  struct packed {
    logic [3:0] item_0;
    logic [3:0] item_1;
  } payload;
} frame_t__fsmgen_t;
```

Record members keep authored field names. List members use deterministic
synthetic names like `item_0`, `item_1`, and so on.

## Width Tokens From Types And Scalars

Direct-root `+size` and composition `?ports` widths may now come from:

- raw positive integers
- local scalar type aliases
- imported package-qualified scalar type aliases
- local positive integer scalar symbols
- imported positive integer scalar symbols

Example:

```lisp
(+constants
  (BYTE_W 8)
)

(+types
  (type byte (bits BYTE_W))
)
```

And in composition:

```lisp
(?ports:public_io
  data_in<BYTE_W
  packed_out>byte
)
```

## Imports

Use `+import` to pull semantic package symbols into scope.

```lisp
(+import shared)
```

The imported names stay namespaced:

- `shared.RESET_BYTE`
- `shared.mode.BUSY`
- `shared.frame_t`
- `shared.BYTES[1]`
- `shared.FRAME.flag`

That is intentional. FSMGen packages are semantic imports, not textual include
files.

## Declarative Scope

Within one declaration family, normal non-cyclic references are no longer
order-dependent.

This is valid:

```lisp
(+constants
  (PACKET (HEADER mode.IDLE))
  (HEADER (mode.BUSY RESET_BYTE))
  (RESET_BYTE 8'hA5)
)
```

But explicit cycles still fail:

```lisp
(+constants
  (A B)
  (B A)
)
```

## Current Boundary

What is shipped today:

- named scalar constants
- bounded aggregate constants
- enum families
- scalar type aliases
- packed list and record aliases
- semantic imports from `?pkg`
- declared-type preservation across the live pipeline
- direct generated-module packed typedef emission for aggregate aliases
- composition-top packed typedef emission for aggregate aliases

What is still future work:

- broader inference-first typing so users need fewer explicit anchors
- deeper type-directed aggregate member/index access in emitted expressions
- VHDL aggregate-type lowering beyond current scalar/width-safe surfaces
- richer public type/export surfaces for embedders
