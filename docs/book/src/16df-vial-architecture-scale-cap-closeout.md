# Architecture-Scale Cap Closeout

Task-tree leaf `.17.4.8` owns the final cross-family proof for the resource-cap
policy selected by [decision 0093](../../decisions/0093-architecture-scale-caps-are-component-ceilings-with-explicit-route-authority.md).
This work does not raise or lower a cap, promote a support statement or budget,
or turn component defenses into whole-product capacity claims.

## What the live policy already proves

`FSM::VIAL::ArchitectureScaleCapPolicy` rebuilds the workload catalog and the
declaring parser, semantic, bridge, execution, and backend authorities. The
inventory audit found a complete one-group join for every selected workload
axis, retained interactions and non-axis envelopes, the backend/runtime
profile split, and an existing path for every referenced evidence owner. The
focused mutation watcher rejects a missing axis, rewritten workload level, or
caller mutation. The reverify command below derives the current counts instead
of asking readers to trust duplicated point-in-time numerals.

That is necessary alignment evidence, but it is not the final closeout proof.
The runtime group still cites the three earlier materialization witnesses while
the completed runtime leaf has a much larger set of boundary, admission,
cleanup, and process-containment witnesses. The policy test validates the
generic catalog join but does not yet bind that runtime evidence or the same
guarantees across every other group.

## Why calibration publication is separate

The immutable calibration closure remains measurement evidence. Its publisher
revision predates the cap-hardening leaves, and its public nonclaims explicitly
include `cap_implementation`. Byte-valid measurement files therefore cannot be
relabelled as proof that the current caps fail atomically or clean up exactly.

The closeout layer will consume the current cap policy internally, reject
caller-supplied evidence, and keep two questions separate:

- Is the historical measurement publication still internally authentic?
- Does current code satisfy every selected cap's boundary, adjacent excess,
  diagnostic, atomicity, no-tool, cleanup, and accepted-identity contract?

Only after the second answer is complete can `.17.4.8` disposition the
historical publication as reusable, superseded, or requiring a versioned
recapture.

## Reverify the inventory

The policy watcher re-derives declared values and includes its omission and
mutation falsifiers:

```sh
prove -Iperl t/1685-vial-architecture-scale-cap-policy.t
```

The exact inventory can be reconstructed directly from the policy object:

```sh
perl -Iperl -MFSM::VIAL::ArchitectureScaleCapPolicy=build_architecture_scale_cap_policy -e '
  my $p = build_architecture_scale_cap_policy();
  my $axes = 0;
  $axes += keys %$_ for values %{$p->{axis_groups}};
  print "axes=$axes groups=", scalar(keys %{$p->{groups}}),
        " interactions=", scalar(keys %{$p->{interactions}}),
        " envelopes=", scalar(keys %{$p->{non_axis_envelopes}}), "\n";
'
```

The owning task-tree records the independent re-derivation, falsification, and
durability legs. The next implementation slice adds the caller-sealed
cross-family consistency layer; it does not alter product behavior.
