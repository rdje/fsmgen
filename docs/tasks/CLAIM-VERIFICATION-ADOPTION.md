# CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION: Adopt Three-Leg Claim Verification

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION`
- Status: `active`
- Roadmap lane: `infra/evidence governance`
- Created: `2026-08-20`
- Last updated: `2026-08-20`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

Adopt a project-owned claim-verification standard so every actionable
quantitative claim names dimensionally distinct re-derivation, falsification,
and durability evidence, and so missing evidence is visible instead of being
hidden behind repeated checks of the same kind.

## Non-Goals

- Do not claim that a structural tag or doctrine gate can prove human intent,
  semantic truth, or the independence of an oracle by itself.
- Do not convert dates, versions, task IDs, schema identifiers, HDL literals,
  example values, or transient command output into permanent claim records
  merely because they contain digits.
- Do not change FSMGen language, lowering, HDL, verification, or support
  behavior while adopting this evidence policy.
- Do not treat the originating PGEN copy as an automatically synchronized
  upstream after FSMGen adopts its own authoritative copy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- FSMGen owns an authoritative repository-root `CLAIM_VERIFICATION.md` with a
  fenced local adoption note and explicit discovery from the tool-neutral
  bootstrap and stable documentation routes.
- Actionable quantitative claims use a bounded record that names the claim,
  re-derivation, a separating falsification oracle or an explicit missing leg,
  and durable producer/watcher evidence or an explicit missing leg.
- A registered doctrine check validates the mechanically decidable record
  shape and its declared tracked paths, runs through the commit hook and CI
  doctrine driver, and has positive plus deliberately failing controls.
- Existing high-traffic current surfaces and repository-derived constants are
  inventoried; each actionable claim is migrated, derived/gated, or assigned a
  task-owned debt disposition without pretending the inventory proves truth.
- Focused validation and `scripts/check_doctrines.sh` pass for every slice;
  full CI remains reserved for the next push or a separately selected major
  boundary.
- The task index and bounded resume pointer remain synchronized, and each
  completed leaf is committed through `COMMIT.md`.

## Task Tree

- ID: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: `Adopt and enforce dimensionally independent claim evidence.`
  Children: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.1, CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.2, CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.3, CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.4, CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.5, CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.6`

- ID: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.1`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: `Select FSMGen's local authority, scope, three-leg record, enforcement boundary, and migration sequence.`
  Acceptance: `Decision 0074 records the project-owned contract, the distinction between actionable claims and incidental numerals, the honest limit of structural enforcement, and the separately owned implementation leaves.`
  Verification: `PASS — scripts/check_task_tree_integrity.pl; scripts/check_docs_relative_paths.sh; git diff --check`
  Commit: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.1: select three-leg claim evidence`

- ID: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.2`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: `Install the project-owned standard and wire stable discovery surfaces.`
  Acceptance: `The root standard has a fenced FSMGen adoption note; AGENTS, README, doctrine architecture, commit guidance, and the book reference map point to the canonical copy without duplicating its body; containment owns every new live path.`
  Verification: `PASS — neutral-body SHA-256 identity; bootstrap syntax/invariants; README routing; live-document/reference authority; docs-relative-path tests; mdBook build; doctrine gate`
  Commit: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.2: install the authoritative claim standard`

- ID: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.3`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: `Implement the bounded claim-record checker and register it as a doctrine.`
  Acceptance: `A data-only bounded registry and deterministic checker validate claim IDs, source paths, exact record markers, all three named legs or explicit gaps, tracked producers/watchers, and path locality; positive fixtures pass and mutations that remove or alias a leg demonstrably fail RED.`
  Verification: `PASS — bounded registry/checker; 8 positive, gap, and RED subtests; bootstrap/Knowledge Map/live-document gates; mdBook; doctrine gate`
  Commit: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.3: gate bounded three-leg claim records`

- ID: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.4`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: `Inventory existing actionable quantitative claims and derived constants on mandatory/current surfaces.`
  Acceptance: `The producer-derived sweep covers 73 current Markdown sources and 615 numeric doctrine constants; it partitions 10,666 numeric lines into 1,417 actionable candidates and four explicit incidental classes, reports producer/watcher state, and assigns every open candidate to CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.5 without representing the inventory as truth proof.`
  Verification: `PASS — independent git-grep census parity; canonical tracked inventory identity; Files=1, Tests=5 for drift, conservative-classifier, untracked-producer, and structural-partition RED controls; bootstrap/live-document gates`
  Commit: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.4: inventory current claims and constants`

- ID: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.5`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: `Migrate or gate the inventoried claims in bounded, surface-owned slices.`
  Acceptance: `Each claim is re-derived, falsified by a separating oracle where available, and made durable, or it names its missing leg and a task-owned repair; repository-derived constants are derived or input-identity gated rather than hand-carried.`
  Verification: `per-claim commands, observed RED controls, watcher/input mutation controls, and doctrine gate`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.6`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: `Close adoption with a complete current-surface audit and recoverable handoff.`
  Acceptance: `The authoritative policy, discovery, registry, checker, migrated claims, explicit debt, task evidence, book, and resume pointer agree; no adoption artifact is off-volume, untracked, or reachable only from conversation.`
  Verification: `focused adoption suite, full doctrine gate, clean tracked/untracked census, and task integrity`
  Commit: `pending`

## Decisions

- `2026-08-20`: Decision `0074` selects re-derive, falsify, and durability as
  three distinct publication legs. Structural enforcement checks declared
  records and evidence plumbing; it never represents formatting as proof of a
  claim's semantic truth.
- `2026-08-20`: The external PGEN document is an adoption source, not a live
  dependency. FSMGen's repository-root copy becomes authoritative once leaf
  `.2` lands.
- `2026-08-20`: Adoption precedes the recorded HIAL backend-emission frontier
  because the director explicitly requested this missing policy and the
  repository was clean, making the pivot handoff-safe.
- `2026-08-20`: The inventory classifier has no incidental fallback. Numeric
  prose not proven to be structure, code/data, a watched generated projection,
  or an identifier remains actionable review debt owned by leaf `.5`.

## Open Questions

- None blocking. Leaf `.5` must split its 1,417-candidate review/migration
  frontier into governed surface-owned slices before changing a claim.

## Blockers

- None.

## Acceptance Checklist (enforced for implementation changes)

- [x] **ROOT CAUSE (WHY + WHERE)** — `git log -S'inventory_scope.json' --oneline d255b364f -- doctrine scripts t docs/book/src KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md` returned no match: the installed claim-record doctrine had no producer-derived current-surface inventory, independent census, or exact migration disposition for existing quantitative prose and control constants.
- [x] **ADDRESSED (verified)** — `scripts/check_claim_verification_inventory.pl --report` reproduced `numeric_lines=10666`, `candidates=1417`, `quantified=655`, `conservative=762`, `constants=615`, `untracked_producers=0`, and `unwatched_candidates=1417`; `prove -Iperl -v t/1637-claim-verification-inventory.t` reported `Files=1, Tests=5` after proving census parity plus inventory-drift, conservative-classifier, untracked-producer, and structural-partition controls.
- [x] **NO REGRESSION** — `prove -Iperl -v t/1637-claim-verification-inventory.t` reported `All tests successful` and `Files=1, Tests=5`; bootstrap, claim verification, and live-document containment passed with `3021/3021` declared document paths, the RAM-guarded mdBook build completed, and the driver reported `[doctrine] all doctrine checks passed` for all 11 registered doctrines.
