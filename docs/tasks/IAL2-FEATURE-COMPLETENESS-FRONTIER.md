# IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER: IAL2 Feature Completeness Frontier

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER`
- Status: `active`
- Roadmap lane: `IAL2 / SV-backed feature completeness`
- Created: `2026-06-12`
- Last updated: `2026-06-12`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

Drive IAL2 toward feature completeness on the SystemVerilog-backed lowering
path before reopening VHDL backend or VHDL rerouting work.

## Non-Goals

- Do not implement VHDL backend or VHDL reroute work from this tree.
- Do not claim IAL2 is feature complete until all selected protocol/platform
  intent surfaces, diagnostics, generated IAL1/IAL0 review artifacts, HDL
  generation, reports, and mdBook documentation are task-tree owned and
  verified.
- Do not bypass the required `IAL2 -> IAL1 -> IAL0 -> SystemVerilog` lowering
  chain.
- Do not widen `.isf` with IAL2 source forms by accident; any IAL1 feature
  required by IAL2 must be explicitly selected, task-tree owned, documented,
  and regression-backed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The first leaf audits shipped IAL2 surfaces and selects the next exact
  feature-completeness slice before behavior changes.
- The audit explicitly records any IAL1 or IAL0/SV prerequisites required by
  the selected IAL2 slice.
- Every implementation leaf preserves reviewable generated IAL1 and IAL0
  artifacts before SystemVerilog HDL generation.
- Public contracts, diagnostics, mdBook, roadmap, and Knowledge Map are kept in
  sync for each shipped IAL2 capability.
- Each completed leaf is committed through `COMMIT.md`.

## Task Tree

- ID: `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: `Make IAL2 feature-complete on the SystemVerilog-backed path before VHDL work resumes.`
  Children: `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.1, IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.2`

- ID: `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.1`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: `Audit the shipped IAL2 surface and select the next exact feature-completeness slice.`
  Acceptance: `The selector records shipped IAL2 capabilities, missing feature-completeness surfaces, likely next slice, required IAL1/IAL0/SV prerequisites, validation gates, rollback boundary, docs/contracts to update, and any blockers before behavior changes.`
  Verification: `Read README.md, MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md, COMMIT.md, docs/TASK_TREE.md, relevant decisions, Knowledge Map fact cards, AXI/IAL2 design notes, mdBook IAL2 section, and focused PPIF/ValidReady code/tests; selected .2 as the next exact pre-code owner; doc/continuity gates passed.`
  Commit: `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.1: select next IAL2 slice`

- ID: `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: `Select the first post-Valid-Ready AXI manager rule subset and pre-code contract.`
  Acceptance: `The selector chooses one bounded source-anchored AXI manager subset from the rule matrix, records exact source anchors, authored .ppif/profile surface expectations, generated IAL1 .isf review artifact shape, generated IAL0 .fsm/HDL expectations, required IAL1 or IAL0/SV prerequisites, diagnostics/report contracts, mdBook/public contract updates, validation gates, explicit residue, and the rollback boundary before any manager behavior is implemented.`
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.2` | `pending` | The shipped IAL2 surface is Valid-Ready single/bundle support; the largest feature-completeness gap is the full AXI manager, which needs a bounded rule-subset contract before behavior changes. |

## Decisions

- `2026-06-12`: Prioritize IAL2 feature completeness on the
  SystemVerilog-backed path before reopening VHDL backend or direct VHDL
  rerouting work.
- `2026-06-12`: IAL2 feature-completeness slices may require new IAL1 and
  IAL0/SV support. Those prerequisites are in scope when explicitly selected
  by a task-tree leaf and must preserve the reviewable lowering chain.
- `2026-06-12`: Selector `.1` audited the shipped IAL2 surface. Shipped:
  `FSM::IAL2::ProtocolIntent::ValidReadyChannel`, public `.ppif` single
  Valid-Ready input, multi-channel `.ppif` Valid-Ready bundles, aggregate IAL2
  report JSON, public check JSON/source identity, aggregate semantic JSON,
  generated `.isf`/`.fsm` review artifacts, and aggregate wrapper/top
  SystemVerilog HDL plus `--verify-hdl` for the tracked AW/W sample.
- `2026-06-12`: Still missing for IAL2 feature completeness: full AXI manager
  behavior, transaction IDs, outstanding read/write windows, same-ID ordering,
  different-ID interleaving, response matching, burst/last-beat tracking,
  cross-channel dependency rules, platform placement/resource mapping,
  additional `.ppif` protocol/platform objects or clauses, and `.pif`/`.ppi`
  or profile alias suffixes such as `.axi`.
- `2026-06-12`: The next exact slice is
  `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.2`: select the first AXI manager rule
  subset and pre-code contract from
  `docs/AXI_MANAGER_RULE_MATRIX_DESIGN_PROBE.md`. Alias suffixes and extra
  `.ppif` syntax are lower priority than the manager rule engine because they
  widen entrypoints without closing the main behavior gap.
- `2026-06-12`: `.2` must not implement behavior. It must select one bounded
  rule family, preserve the mandatory `IAL2 -> IAL1 -> IAL0 -> SystemVerilog`
  chain, identify any required IAL1/IAL0/SV substrate first, and keep Easy
  mode from degenerating into one-transaction-at-a-time behavior unless the
  selected user configuration explicitly has one slot.
- `2026-06-12`: Expected validation gates for a later implementation leaf
  selected by `.2` include focused PPIF/parser diagnostics, generated IAL1 and
  IAL0 review-artifact assertions, report/semantic JSON contract checks,
  focused HDL generation and `--verify-hdl` for the selected subset, mdBook
  runnable examples, Knowledge Map sync, memory-architecture check, and
  doc-path/diff hygiene. The selector itself remains docs-only.
- `2026-06-12`: Rollback boundary for this selector is documentation-only:
  revert the `.1` selector edits, Knowledge Map fact card/map regeneration,
  README, roadmap, and mdBook wording. No code, parser, test, or generated HDL
  behavior is changed by `.1`.

## Open Questions

- `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.2` must decide the exact first AXI
  manager rule family. Candidate families include outstanding capacity and
  status feedback, ID allocation/user-ID validation, same-ID ordering queues,
  response matching, read-data interleaving policy, or write-data sequencing.
- `.2` must also decide whether the selected subset can be expressed as a new
  `.ppif` clause, an in-process manager object first, or a profile/vocabulary
  shape that still lowers through reviewable `.isf` before `.fsm`.

## Blockers

- Not blocked.
