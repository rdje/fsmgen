# HIAL-VIAL-VERIFICATION-FIXTURE-ARCHITECTURE: Hardware And Verification Intent Architecture

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `HIAL-VIAL-VERIFICATION-FIXTURE-ARCHITECTURE`
- Status: `proposed`
- Roadmap lane: `Verification code generation / intent architecture`
- Created: `2026-07-29`
- Last updated: `2026-07-29`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

Define two peer intent systems for FSMGen: Hardware IAL (HIAL), preserving the
current synthesizable IAL0/IAL1/IAL2 lowering stack, and Verification IAL
(VIAL), a pure-verification intent system capable of describing extensive,
elegant test fixtures for HIAL-generated designs. HIAL must target
synthesizable SystemVerilog and synthesizable VHDL; VIAL must target native
SystemVerilog/UVM or VHDL verification code through a typed, language-neutral
HIAL/VIAL bridge.

## Origin And Current Boundary

The director established this product requirement on `2026-07-29` after the
handwritten AHB subordinate arbitration harness demonstrated behavior well
beyond the shipped verification-output skeletons. Today, IAL1 passive
`(observe ...)` metadata can emit an inert UVM passive-monitor package skeleton
or an inert VHDL observation package. It cannot sample a DUT, generate
stimulus, publish transactions, run scenarios, compare expected results,
scoreboard, collect behavioral coverage, inject faults, or generate a runnable
testbench. Those facts remain owned by completed
`IAL1-VERIFICATION-CODE-GENERATION-FRONTIER`; this proposed tree defines the
architecture needed to move beyond that bounded foundation.

## Non-Goals

- Do not rename current IAL0/IAL1/IAL2 files, suffixes, public commands, or
  diagnostics merely to introduce the HIAL term; compatibility and migration
  require an explicit later contract.
- Do not assume that VIAL must have VIAL0/VIAL1/VIAL2 layers. The first audit
  must derive the minimum useful topology from verification semantics and
  lowering boundaries.
- Do not recreate SystemVerilog, UVM, or VHDL as a closed domain-specific
  language. Portable intent must compose with typed, reviewable native
  extension points for backend-specific power.
- Do not mix non-synthesizable VIAL behavior into HIAL's synthesizable output
  contract.
- Do not claim behavioral UVM/VHDL verification generation, backend parity,
  mixed-language execution, or large-design scalability before exact
  implementation and validation owners ship.
- Do not activate this tree or change the current IAL2 roadmap priority merely
  by parking the architecture requirement.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The architecture names current synthesizable IAL0/IAL1/IAL2 collectively as
  HIAL while preserving their compatibility contract unless a later migration
  leaf explicitly selects a public change.
- The VIAL topology audit either selects VIAL0/VIAL1/VIAL2 with precise roles
  or selects a different minimal layering and records why.
- A typed, language-neutral HIAL/VIAL bridge identifies DUT interfaces,
  clocks/resets, transactions, protocol facts, configuration, and source
  identity without binding portable intent to one HDL.
- The portable VIAL semantic model covers stimulus, transactions, scenarios,
  concurrency, expected outcomes, temporal checks, reference models,
  scoreboards, functional coverage, and fault injection.
- The backend contract distinguishes HIAL-to-synthesizable-SystemVerilog and
  HIAL-to-synthesizable-VHDL from VIAL-to-SystemVerilog/UVM and
  VIAL-to-VHDL-verification lowerings.
- Equivalent VIAL intent has explicit cross-backend semantic-parity criteria;
  mixed-language HIAL/VIAL combinations remain a separately gated target where
  supported by the selected toolchain.
- The validation matrix separates a fast portable SystemVerilog profile using
  Verilator's supported synthesis-oriented subset from an authoritative
  full-language/SystemVerilog-UVM profile using a capability-qualified
  simulator. Tool versions and exercised capabilities are reported, and the
  portable profile never implies full SystemVerilog LRM or UVM support.
- VHDL verification receives an equally explicit analyzer/simulator profile;
  open-source portability, full-language qualification, and mixed-language
  qualification are separate claims rather than one inferred capability.
- Native extension points are typed, scoped, traceable to VIAL source, and
  readable in generated artifacts; they extend rather than clone the target
  verification languages.
- The audit maps migration and reuse of current IAL1 checks/properties,
  `(observe ...)` metadata, the inert UVM monitor skeleton, and the inert VHDL
  observation package.
- A worked architecture example maps the handwritten
  `t/data/ahb_generated_subordinate_base_output_arbitration_tb.svt` fixture to
  proposed portable VIAL intent and typed native escape points without
  implementing or claiming generated behavior.
- Scalability, deterministic output, source traceability, generated-code
  readability, compile/simulation/formal validation, and support-accounting
  gates are defined for large to very large designs before implementation.
- Roadmap, mdBook, task index, Memory, Knowledge Map, and git history remain
  aligned, and every implementation slice is committed through `COMMIT.md`.

## Task Tree

- ID: `HIAL-VIAL-VERIFICATION-FIXTURE-ARCHITECTURE`
  Status: `proposed`
  Goal: `Define peer HIAL and VIAL intent systems and their typed bridge so synthesizable hardware and powerful generated verification share one traceable architecture.`
  Children: `HIAL-VIAL-VERIFICATION-FIXTURE-ARCHITECTURE.1`

- ID: `HIAL-VIAL-VERIFICATION-FIXTURE-ARCHITECTURE.1`
  Status: `proposed`
  Goal: `Audit and select the HIAL/VIAL architecture, VIAL layer topology, typed bridge, portable verification semantics, native extension model, backend matrix, migration path, scalability contract, and validation gates.`
  Acceptance: `The audit reads the current IAL0/IAL1/IAL2 contracts and lowerings, SystemVerilog and VHDL hardware backends, IAL1 verification metadata and generated skeletons, public artifact/report/support surfaces, the handwritten AHB arbitration fixture, UVM and VHDL reference constraints, and large-design doctrine; it produces a reviewable architecture decision and decomposes implementation into exact source-model, bridge, backend, tooling, validation, migration, documentation, and scale-proof leaves. It makes no parser, lowering, generated artifact, CLI, report, support-accounting, HDL, UVM, VHDL, test, or runtime behavior change.`
  Verification: `pending activation`
  Commit: `pending activation`

## Current Frontier

This tree is proposed and inactive. `HIAL-VIAL-VERIFICATION-FIXTURE-ARCHITECTURE.1`
is the first executable leaf only after a future clean-boundary roadmap selector
activates it. The smaller adjacent two-subordinate exact-three paired AHB
readiness audit `.1` now passes and clean audit commit `c2aa63c3e` activates
generic contract `.2`. Completed `.2` selects proposed data-only implementation
`.3`, now active after clean contract commit `129d52967`. This architecture
stays proposed; the simulator profile agreement does not pre-empt that
evidence-backed handoff.

## Decisions

- `2026-07-29`: Name the two peer domains HIAL (hardware intent) and VIAL
  (verification intent). HIAL is the architectural name for the current
  synthesizable IAL0/IAL1/IAL2 stack; VIAL is pure verification intent.
- `2026-07-29`: Require HIAL lowerings to synthesizable SystemVerilog and VHDL,
  and VIAL lowerings to native SystemVerilog/UVM or VHDL verification code.
- `2026-07-29`: Join the domains through a typed, language-neutral bridge and
  typed native extension points. Do not solve expressiveness by cloning the
  target verification languages.
- `2026-07-29`: Treat VIAL0/VIAL1/VIAL2 as a topology hypothesis, not a
  decision. The architecture audit must select and justify the layers.
- `2026-07-29`: Park this architecture as proposed/inactive and resume the
  existing IAL2 roadmap priority after the parking commit.
- `2026-07-29`: Require explicit verification-tool capability profiles. Use
  Verilator as the fast portable SystemVerilog subset tier, not as full-LRM or
  UVM authority; require a separately qualified full-language/UVM simulator
  tier for advanced native VIAL output. Apply the same claim-by-capability rule
  to VHDL and mixed-language verification. This requirement records the
  director's agreement but does not itself activate this proposed tree.
- `2026-07-29`: Describe Verilator precisely as event-capable compiled
  simulation, not a traditional full-language event-driven simulator. Its
  explicit model-evaluation loop and `--timing` scheduling of supported delays,
  event controls, waits, forks, and delayed processes strengthen rather than
  erase the separate full-language/UVM profile requirement.
- `2026-07-29`: Parent selector `.819` retains this proposed boundary and
  selects the smaller adjacent two-window exact-three AHB readiness audit.

## Open Questions

- Which verification semantics belong in portable VIAL and which require
  typed backend-native extensions?
- Does VIAL need three layers corresponding to HIAL0/HIAL1/HIAL2, or do its
  elaboration, scenario, and backend boundaries imply a different topology?
- What stable typed bridge lets one VIAL fixture bind equally to HIAL-generated
  SystemVerilog and VHDL DUTs without leaking backend syntax?
- What parity metric proves equivalent stimulus, checking, coverage intent,
  and outcomes across SystemVerilog/UVM and VHDL verification backends?
- Which mixed-language combinations can be validated locally and in CI, and
  which must remain toolchain-qualified capability claims?
- Which full-language/UVM simulator or simulator matrix (for example Questa,
  VCS, or Xcelium) will be available for authoritative native-VIAL validation,
  and which exact language/UVM capabilities will each profile claim?
- How should portable VIAL and native extensions remain deterministic,
  traceable, reviewable, and scalable on very large generated designs?

## Blockers

- None for future architecture audit. Activation and priority remain
  intentionally unselected.
