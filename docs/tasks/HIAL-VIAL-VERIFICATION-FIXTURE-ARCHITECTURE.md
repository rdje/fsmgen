# HIAL-VIAL-VERIFICATION-FIXTURE-ARCHITECTURE: Hardware And Verification Intent Architecture

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `HIAL-VIAL-VERIFICATION-FIXTURE-ARCHITECTURE`
- Status: `active`
- Roadmap lane: `Verification code generation / intent architecture`
- Created: `2026-07-29`
- Last updated: `2026-07-31`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

Define two peer intent systems for FSMGen: Hardware IAL (HIAL), preserving the
current synthesizable IAL0/IAL1/IAL2 lowering stack, and Verification IAL
(VIAL), a pure-verification intent system capable of describing extensive,
elegant test fixtures for HIAL-generated designs. HIAL must target
synthesizable SystemVerilog and synthesizable VHDL; VIAL must target native
SystemVerilog/UVM or VHDL verification code through a typed, language-neutral
HIAL/VIAL bridge.

## Origin And Current Boundary

The director established this product requirement on `2026-07-29` after the
handwritten AHB subordinate arbitration harness demonstrated behavior well
beyond the shipped verification-output skeletons. Today, IAL1 passive
`(observe ...)` metadata can emit an inert UVM passive-monitor package skeleton
or an inert VHDL observation package. It cannot sample a DUT, generate
stimulus, publish transactions, run scenarios, compare expected results,
scoreboard, collect behavioral coverage, inject faults, or generate a runnable
testbench. Those facts remain owned by completed
`IAL1-VERIFICATION-CODE-GENERATION-FRONTIER`; this tree now selects and
decomposes the architecture needed to move beyond that bounded foundation.

## Non-Goals

- Do not rename current IAL0/IAL1/IAL2 files, suffixes, public commands, or
  diagnostics merely to introduce the HIAL term; compatibility and migration
  require an explicit later contract.
- Do not assume that VIAL must have VIAL0/VIAL1/VIAL2 layers. The first audit
  must derive the minimum useful topology from verification semantics and
  lowering boundaries.
- Do not recreate SystemVerilog, UVM, or VHDL as a closed domain-specific
  language. Portable intent must compose with typed, reviewable native
  extension points for backend-specific power.
- Do not mix non-synthesizable VIAL behavior into HIAL's synthesizable output
  contract.
- Do not claim behavioral UVM/VHDL verification generation, backend parity,
  mixed-language execution, or large-design scalability before exact
  implementation and validation owners ship.
- Do not treat architecture selection as implicit activation of source,
  lowering, backend, simulator, report, support, or runtime implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The architecture names current synthesizable IAL0/IAL1/IAL2 collectively as
  HIAL while preserving their compatibility contract unless a later migration
  leaf explicitly selects a public change.
- The VIAL topology audit either selects VIAL0/VIAL1/VIAL2 with precise roles
  or selects a different minimal layering and records why.
- A typed, language-neutral HIAL/VIAL bridge identifies DUT interfaces,
  clocks/resets, transactions, protocol facts, configuration, and source
  identity without binding portable intent to one HDL.
- The portable VIAL semantic model covers stimulus, transactions, scenarios,
  concurrency, expected outcomes, temporal checks, reference models,
  scoreboards, functional coverage, and fault injection.
- The backend contract distinguishes HIAL-to-synthesizable-SystemVerilog and
  HIAL-to-synthesizable-VHDL from VIAL-to-SystemVerilog/UVM and
  VIAL-to-VHDL-verification lowerings.
- Equivalent VIAL intent has explicit cross-backend semantic-parity criteria;
  mixed-language HIAL/VIAL combinations remain a separately gated target where
  supported by the selected toolchain.
- The validation matrix separates a fast portable SystemVerilog profile using
  Verilator's supported synthesis-oriented subset from an authoritative
  full-language/SystemVerilog-UVM profile using a capability-qualified
  simulator. Tool versions and exercised capabilities are reported, and the
  portable profile never implies full SystemVerilog LRM or UVM support.
- VHDL verification receives an equally explicit analyzer/simulator profile;
  open-source portability, full-language qualification, and mixed-language
  qualification are separate claims rather than one inferred capability.
- Native extension points are typed, scoped, traceable to VIAL source, and
  readable in generated artifacts; they extend rather than clone the target
  verification languages.
- The audit maps migration and reuse of current IAL1 checks/properties,
  `(observe ...)` metadata, the inert UVM monitor skeleton, and the inert VHDL
  observation package.
- A worked architecture example maps the handwritten
  `t/data/ahb_generated_subordinate_base_output_arbitration_tb.svt` fixture to
  proposed portable VIAL intent and typed native escape points without
  implementing or claiming generated behavior.
- Scalability, deterministic output, source traceability, generated-code
  readability, compile/simulation/formal validation, and support-accounting
  gates are defined for large to very large designs before implementation.
- Roadmap, mdBook, task index, Memory, Knowledge Map, and git history remain
  aligned, and every implementation slice is committed through `COMMIT.md`.

  Goal: `Audit and select the HIAL/VIAL architecture, VIAL layer topology, typed bridge, portable verification semantics, native extension model, backend matrix, migration path, scalability contract, and validation gates.`
  Acceptance: `The audit reads the current IAL0/IAL1/IAL2 contracts and lowerings, SystemVerilog and VHDL hardware backends, IAL1 verification metadata and generated skeletons, public artifact/report/support surfaces, the handwritten AHB arbitration fixture, UVM and VHDL reference constraints, and large-design doctrine; it produces a reviewable architecture decision and decomposes implementation into exact source-model, bridge, backend, tooling, validation, migration, documentation, and scale-proof leaves. It makes no parser, lowering, generated artifact, CLI, report, support-accounting, HDL, UVM, VHDL, test, or runtime behavior change.`
  Verification: `Selected decision 0032 and the canonical audit after reading the live HIAL layer/lowering, backend, verification-output, manifest/accounting, AHB harness, UVM, VHDL/tool-profile, SourceHIR/IR-policy, and scale evidence. The selected topology is one public .vial language, private immutable VIALSemanticIR and VIALExecutionIR, bounded versioned HIALVIALBridgeManifest, typed native extensions, normalized result parity, plain-SV/Verilator first, and separately qualified UVM, VHDL, methodology, and mixed-language profiles. The AHB fixture has an exact portable-versus-probe/native mapping. Leaves .2-.18 own source, bridge, execution, tooling, backends, migration, qualification, scale, and docs. Task-tree integrity passes at two active trees / 864 nodes; documentation audits pass at Files=3, Tests=40; all 37 mdBook chapters test and the 73-file / 16,810,633-byte HTML build passes; Knowledge Map generation/check passes at 1,085 facts / 5,600 question keys; memory, diff, staged acceptance exemption, all eight doctrines, and exact repository-local output cleanup pass.

## Current Frontier

Architecture audit `.1` is complete. Decision `0032` selects one public
`.vial` source language, private immutable `VIALSemanticIR` and
`VIALExecutionIR`, bounded versioned `HIALVIALBridgeManifest`, typed external
native extensions, normalized result parity, plain SystemVerilog/Verilator as
the first runnable backend, and independently qualified UVM, VHDL methodology,
and mixed-language profiles. The canonical audit maps the handwritten AHB
fixture and exact migration/scale/public-surface boundaries. Clean audit commit
`2e2f7d25e` activated only `.2` through a separate continuity transition.
Completed `.2` accepts decision `0033` and the exact source/semantic-IR v1
contract. Proposed `.3` alone is selected next for implementation and requires
a separate clean activation commit.

## Decisions

- `2026-07-29`: Name the two peer domains HIAL (hardware intent) and VIAL
  (verification intent). HIAL is the architectural name for the current
  synthesizable IAL0/IAL1/IAL2 stack; VIAL is pure verification intent.
- `2026-07-29`: Require HIAL lowerings to synthesizable SystemVerilog and VHDL,
  and VIAL lowerings to native SystemVerilog/UVM or VHDL verification code.
- `2026-07-29`: Join the domains through a typed, language-neutral bridge and
  typed native extension points. Do not solve expressiveness by cloning the
  target verification languages.
- `2026-07-29`: Treat VIAL0/VIAL1/VIAL2 as a topology hypothesis, not a
  decision. The architecture audit must select and justify the layers.
- `2026-07-29`: Park this architecture as proposed/inactive and resume the
  existing IAL2 roadmap priority after the parking commit.
- `2026-07-29`: Require explicit verification-tool capability profiles. Use
  Verilator as the fast portable SystemVerilog subset tier, not as full-LRM or
  UVM authority; require a separately qualified full-language/UVM simulator
  tier for advanced native VIAL output. Apply the same claim-by-capability rule
  to VHDL and mixed-language verification. This requirement records the
  director's agreement but does not itself activate this proposed tree.
- `2026-07-29`: Describe Verilator precisely as event-capable compiled
  simulation, not a traditional full-language event-driven simulator. Its
  explicit model-evaluation loop and `--timing` scheduling of supported delays,
  event controls, waits, forks, and delayed processes strengthen rather than
  erase the separate full-language/UVM profile requirement.
- `2026-07-29`: Parent selector `.819` retains this proposed boundary and
  selects the smaller adjacent two-window exact-three AHB readiness audit.
- `2026-07-30`: Parent selector `.832` selects the smaller no-behavior nested-
  bitwise concurrent-assertion precedence audit before this broader
  architecture. HIAL/VIAL remains proposed with every topology, bridge,
  semantics, backend, qualification, parity, migration, and scale requirement
  unchanged.
- `2026-07-30`: Parent selector `.833` selects the smaller mdBook VHDL
  introduction/backend-summary truth repair after assertion precedence ships.
  HIAL/VIAL remains proposed with its complete architecture contract unchanged.
- `2026-07-30`: Parent selector `.841` selects the narrower IR-policy-governed
  source-facing HIR boundary before this comprehensive dual-intent audit.
  HIAL/VIAL remains proposed with every architecture requirement unchanged.
- `2026-07-31`: Parent selector `.844` selects proposed no-behavior audit `.1`
  after the private HIR boundary closes and live task-tree integrity ships.
  The audit remains inactive until a separate clean activation commit.
- `2026-07-31`: Clean parent selector commit `031b21d4f` activates only audit
  `.1`; architecture selection and decomposition remain unperformed until the
  activation commits cleanly.
- `2026-07-31`: Audit `.1` accepts decision `0032`: VIAL uses one public
  `.vial` source plus two private IR stages around a bounded versioned HIAL/VIAL
  bridge, not VIAL0/VIAL1/VIAL2. Plain SystemVerilog/Verilator is first;
  UVM, VHDL methodology, and mixed-language profiles remain separately
  qualified. Proposed `.2` owns the exact source/semantic-IR contract.
- `2026-07-31`: Clean architecture audit commit `2e2f7d25e` activates only
  source/semantic-IR contract `.2`; contract findings and product behavior
  remain unchanged until activation commits cleanly.
- `2026-07-31`: Contract `.2` accepts decision `0033`: VIAL v1 is a closed
  span-aware S-expression language with target-neutral typed semantics and a
  private immutable `VIALSemanticIR`, not raw Lispish forms. Proposed `.3`
  owns the exact bounded implementation after separate activation.

## Open Questions

- `.3` must implement the exact selected grammar, value masks, semantic record,
  defensive report, diagnostics, resource limits, negative corpus, and first
  AHB source without widening the profile or adding a public CLI.
- `.12` must choose the UVM revision and an actually available qualified
  simulator before native UVM implementation can claim compile/runtime support.
- `.14` must choose the VHDL methodology provider and exact analyzer/simulator;
  GHDL and other VHDL tools are currently absent locally.
- `.16` must choose the first available mixed-language tool/profile.
- `.17` must select measured architecture-specific capacity budgets; the
  separate whole-product scale tree retains big/really-big qualification.

## Blockers

- None for selected `.3` after its required separate activation. Later UVM,
  VHDL, and mixed-language implementation/qualification leaves retain explicit
  tool availability prerequisites and cannot borrow the current Verilator
  result.

## Changelog

- `2026-07-29`: Added the director-agreed portable-Verilator versus
  full-language/SystemVerilog-UVM validation-profile requirement, with separate
  VHDL and mixed-language claim qualification; the tree remains proposed while
  parent selector `.817` selected the smaller adjacent AHB alias.
- `2026-07-29`: Parent selector `.819` keeps the architecture proposed while
  selecting the bounded two-window exact-three AHB readiness audit.
- `2026-07-29`: The bounded child audit/contract/implementation now ships the
  generic two-window exact-three source at 325/366/49. Proposed parent selector

  smaller shipped AXI concurrent-assertion correctness audit first. HIAL/VIAL
