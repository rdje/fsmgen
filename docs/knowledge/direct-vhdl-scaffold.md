Direct single-FSM roots can now use `target_language => 'vhdl'` or
`--language vhdl` for the shipped scaffold subset: scalar/vector ports, state
constants, enable assignments, sync/async reset processes, `process(all)`
combinational muxes, basic concat RHS forms, and delayed-pulse clock-branch
nested-if lowering. Composition/top VHDL, aggregate-output VHDL, packages,
multi-clock domains, arithmetic/broad expression parity, GHDL validation, and
full SystemVerilog parity remain deferred or fail-closed.
