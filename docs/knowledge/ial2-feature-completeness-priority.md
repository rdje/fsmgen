The current feature-completeness priority is IAL2 on the
SystemVerilog-backed path.

`IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.15` owns the next PNT implementation
frontier: additive AXI manager transaction event dispatch and direction fan-in
under the existing `manager-capacity-status` object. The completed `.14`
readiness audit selected that boundary with no separate IAL1, IAL0, or
SystemVerilog prerequisite first.

Selected IAL2 work may include required IAL1 or IAL0/SV support, but only when
those prerequisites are explicit, task-tree owned, documented, and
regression-backed. VHDL backend/reroute work remains deferred until the
SV-backed IAL0/IAL1/IAL2 path is feature complete.
