Decisions `0055` and `0056` select architecture-scale proof without claiming capacity.
Six orthogonal families isolate source/SemanticIR, bridge fanout, execution
graphs, checking state, backend emission, and runtime streams; one conservative
balanced candidate checks interaction. Each axis has reference, gate-candidate,
qualification-candidate, exact-limit, and over-limit levels. Every timing/RSS
sample is invalid unless its stage-local semantic, identity, source-map,
artifact, deterministic-rerun, result, failure, and cleanup oracles pass.
Fixed 88%-host/4,096-MiB-descendant safety applies immediately; performance
budgets derive immutably from clean pinned-host calibration and do not fail on
unmatched hosts. Earliest-cap dominance is reported honestly. These candidates
are not support, multi-unit/domain, mixed-language, native-UVM-runtime, full-
language, whole-product `big`/`really_big`, synthesis, or general-parity claims.

Completed `.17.2.1`-`.17.2.5` cover source through checking state. Decision
`0075` selects checked-AHB backend routes: portable SV accepts `T=6,319` and
rejects `6,320`; portable VHDL/OSVVM select `29,508/29,509`; native UVM emits
only `T=21` and rejects `T=22`. The closed `BackendEmissionAuthority`, repair
parent `.17.2.6.2`, caller-sealed foundation `.17.2.6.3.1`, four profile
ladders, and family closure `.17.2.6.3.6` preserve exact inventories, maps,
checks, content-addressed reruns, atomic rejection, and cleanup. Runtime
`.17.2.7.1` constructs three profiles/five levels without provider/tool
execution or runtime/capacity claims. Exact historical counts remain in the
task evidence and decisions `0075`/`0055`, not duplicated here.

Decision `0077` resolves balanced `.17.2.7.2` without widening portable AHB or
revision-1 scale. The private direct-IAL1 `architecture_scale_probe` profile is
`balanced_portable` revision `2`, with exact facts and capability
`hial_vial.bridge_qualification.balanced_portable_v2`. Caller-sealed bridge,
execution, backend-input, and portable-SV entrypoints independently validate
full identities and shapes; public callers, near misses, mutation, and forged
identity fail closed. The real binding equation remains one unit/domain, 126
data endpoints, 32 probes, 16 aliases, 1,744 fields, and 128 events: 2,048
bindings, 109 fields per alias. Completed `.2.3` regenerates source, runs six
fresh gates, rebuilds stages twice plus replay, derives all semantics, and
rejects injected evidence. Completed `.2.4` then negotiates fifteen exact
requirements and emits a byte-equal eight-artifact/three-source graph: 503,279
source bytes and 3,605 maps cover all 1,024 operations and 2,048 bindings.
Public bypass and hostile evidence reject atomically; repository-volume staging
is residue-free. Completed `.17.2.7.3` closes deterministic generation with one
exact fifteen-runtime/one-balanced ownership partition. It constructs each
member only through its family producer, embeds every complete child report and
authority identity, normalizes stage applicability without erasing child
semantics, and independently regenerates the complete aggregate from checked
sources. Nested runtime/balanced staging cleans both repository-volume roots
after success or failure. Public planning/AHB/revision 1/other backends and
provider, compile, runtime, trace, result, support, performance, capacity, and
reached-boundary claims stay unchanged and unclaimed. Focused t/1653-t/1655
re-derive and falsify these boundaries; `.17.2` is complete.

Completed `.17.3.1` provides the common measurement foundation without running
a provider or external verification tool. It closes all twelve decision-0056
stage records, requires correctness-only validation before a guarded measured
ordinal, samples controller and descendant process evidence every 250 ms,
retains explicit unsupported reasons, enforces the smaller stage/backend
timeout, validates disjoint stage artifacts plus the complete owned-tree
census, and removes repository-derived staging after success, exception,
timeout, or rejected output. Accepted measured records publish by same-volume
atomic directory rename; byte-identical retry is unchanged, collision and
injected commit failure are residue-free. The guard wrapper remains the safety
authority and exports only its effective threshold evidence. Workload and
semantic identities exclude volatile measurements. t/1656 re-derives the
record and lifecycle and falsifies forged paths, timeouts, reports, guard
admission, ordinals, stage order, external classification, unreported output,
publication collision, and publication failure. Semantic/bridge family
measurement is active under `.17.3.2`. It alone may adapt the completed
canonical family constructors to the common controller and retain validation
plus three gate or five qualification ordinals. It must re-prove the family
oracle in every sampled run, separate FSMGen-owned construct/parse/bridge
stages, retain earliest-cap and cleanup truth, and mark later stages
inapplicable. It executes no provider, compiler, simulator, or external
verification tool and makes no performance-budget, support, capacity, or
reached-boundary claim; those remain later-owned.
