Decisions `0055` and `0056` select architecture-scale proof without claiming capacity.
Six orthogonal families isolate source/SemanticIR, bridge fanout, execution
graphs, checking state, backend emission, and runtime streams; one conservative
balanced candidate checks interaction. Each axis has reference, gate-candidate,
qualification-candidate, exact-limit, and over-limit levels. Every timing/RSS
sample is invalid unless its stage-local semantic, identity, source-map,
artifact, deterministic-rerun, result, failure, and cleanup oracles pass.
Fixed 88%-host/4,096-MiB-descendant safety applies immediately; performance
budgets derive immutably from clean pinned-host calibration and do not fail on
unmatched hosts. Earliest-cap dominance is reported honestly. These candidates
are not support, multi-unit/domain, mixed-language, native-UVM-runtime, full-
language, whole-product `big`/`really_big`, synthesis, or general-parity claims.

Completed `.17.2.1`-`.17.2.5` cover source through checking state. Decision
`0075` selects checked-AHB backend routes: portable SV accepts `T=6,319` and
rejects `6,320`; portable VHDL/OSVVM select `29,508/29,509`; native UVM emits
only `T=21` and rejects `T=22`. The closed `BackendEmissionAuthority`, repair
parent `.17.2.6.2`, caller-sealed foundation `.17.2.6.3.1`, four profile
ladders, and family closure `.17.2.6.3.6` preserve exact inventories, maps,
checks, content-addressed reruns, atomic rejection, and cleanup. Runtime
`.17.2.7.1` constructs three profiles/five levels without provider/tool
execution or runtime/capacity claims. Exact historical counts remain in the
task evidence and decisions `0075`/`0055`, not duplicated here.

Balanced `.17.2.7.2` is blocked before source authoring. The portable AHB
bridge is closed to one six-field/six-event transaction. The scalable direct-
IAL1 bridge is closed to one field and its caller-sealed ExecutionIR capability
is `qualification_only`/`private_nonportable`, so the portable-SV emitter
rejects it. The selected 2,048-binding shape needs 1,744 field bindings after
one unit/domain, 126 data endpoints, 32 probes, 16 transaction aliases, and 128
events: exactly 109 fields per alias. Unblock by selecting a distinct sealed
revision-2 balanced qualification profile with explicit emitter qualification,
or by revising decision `0055`'s portable/count contract. No protocol or
capability behavior changed during the audit.
