# MEMORY — pointer to the frontier (layer A; state only, overwrite-only)

Pointer only, nothing else — decisions `0067` and `0068`. Rationale: `docs/decisions/`.
Status and evidence: `docs/tasks/`. The system itself: `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Resume

- repository_revision: derive with `git log -1 --format='%H %s'`; never shadow `HEAD` here.
- active_work_unit: `SEMANTIC-INTROSPECTION-MCP-FRONTIER.60.4.3.3.5.2.1.5.2.2.3.1.2.1.3.1.2.3.2.3.3.3.3.2.3.2.3.3.2.3.4.3.3.2.2` (pending recorder delivery)
- next_action: After .2.1 commits cleanly, activate .2.2 and stage its Task/Memory inputs. Run each fixed ORDER cohort once with python3 -B docs/audits/original-join-parent-acceptance-20261018/execute.py <cohort>.
  Keep sources/docs stable between cohorts and consume each result. The recorder stays outside its child RAM guard to retain first failures.
- in_flight_uncommitted: derive with `git status --short`; commit any owned slice before activating its successor.
- in_flight_background: None; consume delivery/normal-commit receipts before selecting any successor.
- blockers: Historical native EPERM attribution stays P1-open with HIAL; the SIP boundary is unchanged.
  Knowledge Map rollover debt forbids allowance growth; preserve all facts/questions. No decision or authentication is pending.
  Historical startup/parent qualification and full CI/push remain gated; Push whenever useful is explicitly authorized by user steering on 2026-10-11; required HIAL/full-CI qualifications still gate it. Visual mdBook QA remains pending.
