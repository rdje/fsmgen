# MEMORY — resume pointer (layer A; overwrite-only, keep ≤ ~60 lines)

See `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the four-layer system. Git preserves prior
history; this file carries only the current bounded resume state.

## Resume

- repository_revision: derive the current commit and subject with
  `git log -1 --format='%H %s'`; do not store a shadow of `HEAD` here.
- active_work_unit: `HIAL-VIAL-VERIFICATION-FIXTURE-ARCHITECTURE.17.2.1`.
- current_state: clean activation `49b6e1ba4`; `.17.2.1` implementation and
  decision `0057` are complete under verification. A pre-existing public
  ArtifactTransaction cleanup defect is tracked separately as proposed `.17.9`.
- next_action: verify and commit `.17.2.1`, then activate `.17.9` from the clean
  foundation commit before `.17.2.2` semantic-family generation.
- in_flight_uncommitted: workload foundation module/test, decision/book/task/
  fact/Memory sync, and maintained-reference authority; no background job or
  generated residue.
- blockers: none.

## Durable context
- Decision `0034`: full power underneath, simpler intent above; VIAL is not
  synthesis-bounded and target methodology stays compiler-private.
- Decisions `0036`/`0037`: logical drive/sample/react/check time and closed
  directional type-representation proofs remain backend authority.
- Decision `0039`: `.10.1`/`.10.2` ship source tooling and atomic planning;
  transaction-free direct IAL0 never infers transaction facts.
- Decision `0043`: Verilator is the first fast known-value runtime profile,
  never the language ceiling or four-state/UVM authority. `.10.3` keeps one
  generated scheduler as semantic authority; `.10.4` now qualifies compile,
  runtime, and normalized results; `.11` now qualifies only the selected AHB
  handwritten-oracle comparison, not general cross-backend parity.
- Decision `0050`: canonical native output is simulator-neutral Accellera UVM;
  provider-specific requirements stay in isolated adapter/command/evidence
  layers and cannot alter VIAL meaning; commercial simulators remain optional.
- Decision `0051`: portable VHDL is provider-free IEEE 1076-2008; OSVVM is the
  selected advanced provider and GHDL 6.0.0 is the first exact tool profile.
  Provider/tool behavior cannot redefine logical time, values, or results.
- `.15.1-.15.4` ship portable emission/review; `.15.5` qualifies exact GHDL
  6.0.0 LLVM-JIT; `.15.6` ships exact OSVVM materialization/emission; `.15.7`
  qualifies their bounded combined profile with portable semantics unchanged.
- Decisions `0041`/`0042`/`0044`/`0045` retain containment authority; retired views are Git-retrievable. Push only on request; PNT is autonomous.
