# MEMORY — resume pointer (layer A; overwrite-only, keep ≤ ~60 lines)

See `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full system. This file is ONLY the bounded
resume pointer: current state + the single next action. Never append to it; its
prior 38,776-line history is preserved in git (recoverable via `git log -- MEMORY.md`).

## How to resume (any model, any harness)
- Read `README.md` (project) and `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` (the memory system — MANDATORY).
- Work is tracked in task-trees under `docs/tasks/` (index `docs/TASK_TREE.md`); commit per `COMMIT.md`.
- Durable cross-cutting facts/decisions live in `docs/decisions/` (index `docs/decisions/INDEX.md`).
- Before committing, run `scripts/check_memory_architecture.sh` (git hooks + CI run it too).

- latest_commit: `HEAD after IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.233 commit` - `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.233: audit dynamic read-data readiness`.
- active_work_unit: `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.234` implements scalar dynamic read-data capture over generated single-active dynamic read response-demux; `IAL1-VERIFICATION-CODE-GENERATION-FRONTIER.4` and `BACKEND-LANGUAGE-PORTABILITY-CONTRACT-FRONTIER.2.2` also remain active/pending.
- recently_done: `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.233` selected `.234`, direct bounded implementation of scalar dynamic read-data capture for the generated dynamic read single-beat and burst-last/`RLAST` demux shapes. No parser, generator, PPIF sample, support-accounting, validation, generated-artifact, test, or HDL behavior changed in `.233`.
- in_flight_uncommitted: none after the `IAL2-FEATURE-COMPLETENESS-FRONTIER.233` commit. The active `.234` implementation must start from `docs/AXI_IAL2_MANAGER_DYNAMIC_READ_DATA_READINESS_AUDIT.md`; reuse existing `read-data.read` syntax; cover exactly one dynamic read transaction; support scalar single-beat and scalar last-beat capture only; keep dynamic burst-length/runtime/multi-beat/multiple/mixed/same-cycle/same-ID/queue/scoreboard/direct-backend/VHDL boundaries fail-closed. Ignored local-only mirrors remain at `.cache/local-references/accellera/uvm/uvm-1.2`, `.cache/local-references/sv/1800-2017`, and `.cache/local-references/sv/1800-2023`.
- blockers: none.

## Notes
- Before re-deriving a logged fact, consult `KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md` (derived question→fact
  index; cards under `docs/knowledge/`, bundle `knowledge-map/`). Write a fact card
  whenever you establish a durable fact or catch archaeology — lazily, never a sweep
  (`docs/tasks/KNOWLEDGE-MAP-ADOPT.md`).
- Push only on explicit user request (no commit-count cadence) — `docs/decisions/0005`.
- PNT autonomously; do not pause mid-flow — `docs/decisions/0003`.
- Heavy broad Perl/`prove`/`fsmgen` commands must run under
  `scripts/run_with_ram_guard.sh` or equivalent monitoring; default cutoff is
  host RAM 88% / descendant RSS 4096 MiB, below the user's 90% danger zone.
- Optional `slang` HDL validation is a future backend-validation candidate only;
  no `--verify-hdl` policy changed in `.194`
  (`docs/knowledge/hdl-validation-slang-candidate.md`).
- Legacy prose blobs (`CHANGES.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md`, `ROADMAP_STATUS.md`,
  `LIVE_ACHIEVEMENT_STATUS.md`) are FROZEN — git is the audit trail (`docs/decisions/0007`).
